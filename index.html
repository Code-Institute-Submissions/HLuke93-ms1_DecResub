               <h1>Why have French Bulldogs become so popular?</h1>
               <p>Frenchies are affectionate, friendly dogs that were bred to be companions. Although they're somewhat slow to be housebroken, they get along well with other dogs and aren't big barkers. The dogs don't need much exercise, so they are fine in small areas and enjoy the safety of a crate.</p>
