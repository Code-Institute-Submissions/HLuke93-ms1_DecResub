# Site Design

* The approach I took designing this website was to display clear , concise text so the user could retain information.
* To do this I added 5 questions and answers on the homepage , some images , a video and a meetup location map.
* I chose 2 fonts when designing this site , Open+Sans and Monserrat , both taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* The color scheme I went with during the design was rgb(66, 66, 66) ![Nav Color](./assets/read-me/navcolor.png) for the Nav Bar and Footer with color: #fff (White) for the links.
  I also used a #00adb5 ![Green Color](./assets/read-me/greencolor.png) color for borders and active links.
* The Default font color was #000000 , However this was amended to rgb(66, 66, 66) ![Font Color](./assets/read-me/navcolor.png) to add more consistancy to the site.
* A Background Color of ##FAF9F6 was added.
